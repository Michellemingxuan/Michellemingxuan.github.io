Hello! I'm Michelle, a passionate junior researcher striving to bridge the gap between AI and healthcare. With a strong foundation in mathematics and statistics, complemented by robust programming skills, I am committed to creating innovative, practical, and trustworthy methodologies. My interests extend to the applications of advanced technologies, such as machine learning and deep learning, to healthcare data.

Currently, my primary focus areas include:  

- Developing methodologies for AI fairness
- Interpretable machine learning with applications in healthcare, particularly within emergency medicine settings (keen to expand this focus to other clinical settings, where fairness is of vital importance and the potential of AI is significant)

If our research interests align, or if you'd simply like to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out via email. Look forward to hearing from you!
